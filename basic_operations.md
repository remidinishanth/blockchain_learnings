* The algorithm for consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain is called **Proof of Work** protocol.
It gets its name because it involves “work” or computational power to solve the puzzle and to claim the right to form the next block.

* Transaction confirmation is independently performed by all miner nodes.
Miners, take on added work or computation to verify transactions, broadcast transactions, compete to claim the right to create a block,
work on reaching consensus by validating the block, broadcasting the newly created block and confirming transactions. 

* Transaction 0 in every block in the bitcoin blockchain
  - is for paying the miner fees
  - does not have any input UTXO
  - is called the coinbase transaction
