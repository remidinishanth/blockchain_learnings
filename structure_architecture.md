Here is the basic structure of a blockchain. 
* **Transaction** is the basic element of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Transactions are validated and broadcast. 
* Many transactions form a **block**. Many box form a chain through a digital data link. 
* Blocks go through a consensus process, to select the next block that will be added to the **chain**. Chosen block is verified, and added to the current chain.
* Validation and consensus process are carried out by special peer nodes called **miners**. These are powerful computers executing software defined by the blockchain protocol. 


Let's now discuss the details of a single transaction in bitcoin. 
* A fundamental concept of a bitcoin network is an **Unspent Transaction Output**, also known as **UTXO**. 
* The set of all UTXOs in a bitcoin network collectively defined the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain.
* UTXOs are referenced as inputs in a transaction. UTXOs those are also outputs generated by a transaction.
* All of that UTXO's is in a system, are stored by the participant nodes in a database.
